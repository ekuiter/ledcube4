#LED Cube 4x4x4

This is my implementation of a 4x4x4 LED cube in Arduino, using shift registers (optionally without).

On this branch (master) you can find the Arduino sketch for the cube.

If you'd like more information on how to build an LED cube yourself, visit the [project homepage](http://elias-kuiter.de/electronics/led-cube/info/en).
There you can find demo videos and information on constructing and programming your own cube.
